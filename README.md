# deep-reinforcement-taxi-v2
This project was part of Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Learning class. It's a solution to the Taxi problem in OpenAI Gym: https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/Leaderboard#taxi-v2

The repo contains three files:

* agent.py: This is the only file that I had to modify.
* monitor.py: The interact function tests how well the agent learns from interaction with the environment. This file was provided by Udacity.
* main.py: The main file to run in the terminal to check the performance of the agent. This file was provided by Udacity.
